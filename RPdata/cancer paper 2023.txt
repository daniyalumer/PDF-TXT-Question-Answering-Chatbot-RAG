Abstract
Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases
and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population‐
based cancer occurrence and outcomes using incidence data collected by central
cancer registries and mortality data collected by the National Center for Health
Statistics. In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are
projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate
cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline,
translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends
were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in
women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015
through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did
liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older
and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence
during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to
receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the
burden of human papillomavirus‐associated cancers, the majority of which occur in
women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death,
the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths
averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are
particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually
during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite
stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary,
although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be
attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers,
which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the
second leading cause of death in the United States. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic caused delays in the
diagnosis and treatment of cancer because of health care setting
closures, disruptions in employment and health insurance, and fear
of COVID‐19 exposure. Although the impact was largest during
the COVID‐19 peak in mid‐2020, the provision of health care has
not fully rebounded. For example, surgical oncology procedures at
Massachusetts General Hospital were 72% of 2019 levels during
the last one half of 2020 and were only 84% in 2021, the lowest
recovery of any surgical specialty.1 Delays in diagnosis and treatment may lead to an uptick in advanced‐stage disease and mortality.2 These and other secondary consequences of the pandemic
will occur gradually over time and will require many years to
quantify at the population level because of the 2‐year to 3‐year
lag in population‐based cancer incidence and mortality data.
However, what is already well established is the disproportionate
direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on communities of
color.3,4
In this article, we provide the estimated numbers of new cancer
cases and deaths in 2023 in the United States nationally and for each
state, as well as a comprehensive overview of cancer occurrence
based on up‐to‐date population‐based data for cancer incidence and
mortality. We also estimate the total number of cancer deaths
averted through 2020 because of the continuous decline in cancer
death rates since the early 1990s.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
Population‐based cancer incidence data in the United States have
been collected by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program since 1973 and by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program
of Cancer Registries (NPCR) since 1995. The SEER program is the
only source for historic, population‐based cancer incidence
(1975–2019), which is currently based on data from the eight
oldest SEER areas (Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah,
and the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, San Francisco–Oakland, and
Seattle–Puget Sound) and represent approximately 8% of the US
population.5 Historic survival data (1975–1977 and 1995–1997) are
based on the SEER 8 areas plus the Detroit metropolitan area,6 as
published previously. Contemporary survival statistics (2012–2018)
were based on data from the 17 SEER registries (SEER 8 plus the
Alaska Native Tumor Registry and the California, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and New Jersey registries), representing 27% of
the US population.7,8 All 22 SEER registries (SEER 17 plus Idaho,
Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas), covering 48% of the
United States, were the source for the probability of developing
cancer, which was obtained using the NCI's DevCan software,
version 6.8.0.9
The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries
(NAACCR) compiles and reports incidence data from 1995 forward
for registries that participate in the SEER program and/or the NPCR
and achieve high‐quality data standards. These data approach 100%
coverage of the US population for the most recent years and were
the source for the projected new cancer cases in 2023, contemporary
incidence trends (1998–2019) and cross‐sectional incidence rates
(2015–2019), and stage distribution (2015–2019).10 The incidence
rates presented herein differ slightly from those published in Cancer
in North America: 2015–2019 because of the use of 19 versus 20 age
groups, respectively, for age adjustment.11,12
Mortality data from 1930 to 2020 were provided by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).13,14 Forty‐seven states and the
District of Columbia met data quality requirements for reporting to
the national vital statistics system in 1930, and Texas, Alaska, and
Hawaii began reporting in 1933, 1959, and 1960, respectively. The
methods for abstraction and age adjustment of historic mortality
data are described elsewhere.14,15 Contemporary 5‐year mortality
rates for Puerto Rico were obtained from the NCI and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention joint website, State Cancer
Profiles (statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov).
All cancer cases were classified according to the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology except childhood and adolescent
cancers, which were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer.
16–18 Causes of death were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases.
19
Statistical analysis
All incidence and death rates were age standardized to the 2000 US
standard population (19 age groups) and expressed per 100,000
persons (or per million for childhood cancer incidence), as calculated
using the NCI's SEER*Stat software, version 8.4.0.20 The annual
percent change in rates was quantified using the NCI's Joinpoint
Regression software program (version 4.9.1.0).21 Trends were
described as increasing or decreasing when the annual percent
change was statistically significant based on a 2‐sided p value < .05
and otherwise were described as stable. All statistics presented
herein by race, including those for Asian American/Pacific Islander
(AAPI) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) individuals, are
exclusive of Hispanic ethnicity for improved accuracy of classification. Racial misclassification for AIAN individuals has been further
reduced by restricting incidence rates to Purchased/Referred Care
Delivery Area counties and adjusting mortality rates (for the entire
United States) using classification ratios previously published by the
NCHS.22 Life tables by Hispanic ethnicity were published in 2018 and
were used for relative survival comparisons between White and
Black individuals.23
Whenever possible, cancer incidence rates were adjusted for
delays in reporting, which occur because of lags in case capture and

data corrections. Delay adjustment provides the most accurate
portrayal of contemporary cancer rates and thus is particularly
important in trend analysis.24 It has the largest effect on the most
recent data years for cancers that are frequently diagnosed in
outpatient settings (e.g., melanoma, leukemia, and prostate cancer).
For example, the leukemia incidence rate for 2019 was 13% higher
after adjusting for reporting delays (14.9 vs. 13.2 per 100,000
persons).25
Projected cancer cases and deaths in 2023
The most recent year for which incidence and mortality data are
available lags 2–4 years behind the current year because of the time
required for data collection, compilation, quality control, and
dissemination. Therefore, we project the numbers of new cancer
cases and deaths in the United States in 2023 to estimate the
contemporary cancer burden using two‐step statistical modeling, as
described in detail elsewhere.26,27 Briefly, complete cancer diagnoses
were estimated for every state from 2005 through 2019 based on
delay‐adjusted, high‐quality incidence data from 50 states and the
District of Columbia (99.7% population coverage; recent data were
unavailable for Nevada) and state‐level variations in sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, medical settings, and cancer screening
behaviors.28 Modeled state and national counts were then projected
forward to 2023 using a novel, data‐driven joinpoint algorithm.27
Ductal carcinoma in situ of the female breast and in situ melanoma of
the skin were estimated by approximating annual case counts from
2010 through 2019 based on NAACCR age‐specific incidence rates,
delay factors for invasive disease (delay factors are unavailable for in
situ cases),29 and US population estimates obtained using SEER*Stat
software.10,30 Counts were then projected four years ahead based on
the average annual percent change generated by the joinpoint
regression model.
The number of cancer deaths expected to occur in 2023 was
estimated by applying the previously described data‐driven joinpoint
algorithm to reported cancer deaths from 2006 through 2020 at the
state and national levels as reported by the NCHS.27 Please note that
the estimated cases for 2023 reported herein are based on currently
available incidence data through 2019 and do not account for the
impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on cancer diagnoses, whereas the
projected cancer deaths in 2023 are based on data through 2020 and
only account for the first year. In addition, basal cell and squamous
cell skin cancers cannot be estimated because diagnoses are not
recorded by most cancer registries.
Other statistics
The number of cancer deaths averted in men and women because of
the reduction in cancer death rates since the early 1990s was estimated by summing the annual difference between the number of
cancer deaths recorded and the number that would have been
expected if cancer death rates had remained at their peak. The expected number of deaths was estimated by applying the 5‐year age‐
specific and sex‐specific cancer death rates in the peak year for age‐
standardized cancer death rates (1990 in men, 1991 in women) to
the corresponding age‐specific and sex‐specific populations in subsequent years through 2020.
SELECTED FINDINGS
Expected number of new cancer cases
Table 1 presents the estimated numbers of new invasive cancer cases
in the United States in 2023 by sex and cancer type. In total, there
will be approximately 1,958,310 new cancer cases, the equivalent of
about 5370 cases each day. In addition, there will be about 55,720
new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ in women and 89,070 new
cases of melanoma in situ of the skin. The estimated numbers of new
cases for selected cancers by state are shown in Table 2.
The lifetime probability of being diagnosed with invasive cancer
is slightly higher for men (40.9%) than for women (39.1%; Table 3).
Higher risk in men for most cancer types is thought to largely reflect
greater exposure to carcinogenic environmental and behavioral factors, such as smoking, although a recent study suggests that other
differences also play a large role.31 These may include height,32,33
endogenous hormone exposure, and immune function and
response.34
Figure 1 depicts the most common cancers diagnosed in men and
women in 2023. Prostate, lung and bronchus (hereinafter lung), and
colorectal cancers (CRCs) account for almost one half (48%) of all
incident cases in men, with prostate cancer alone accounting for 29%
of diagnoses. For women, breast cancer, lung cancer, and CRC account for 52% of all new diagnoses, with breast cancer alone accounting for 31% of female cancers.
Expected number of cancer deaths
An estimated 609,820 people in the United States will die from
cancer in 2023, corresponding to 1670 deaths per day (Table 1). The
greatest number of deaths are from cancers of the lung, prostate, and
colorectum in men and cancers of the lung, breast, and colorectum in
women (Figure 1). Table 4 provides the estimated number of deaths
for these and other common cancers by state.
Approximately 350 people die each day from lung cancer—nearly
2.5 times more than the number of people who die from CRC, which
is the second leading cause of cancer death overall. Approximately
103,000 of the 127,070 lung cancer deaths (81%) in 2023 will be
caused by cigarette smoking directly, with an additional 3560 caused
by second‐hand smoke.35 The remaining balance of approximately
20,500 nonsmoking‐related lung cancer deaths would rank as the
eighth leading cause of cancer death among the sexes combined if it
was classified separately.

More deaths than cases may reflect a lack of specificity in recording underlying cause of death on death certificates and/or an undercount in the case

Trends in cancer incidence
Figure 2 illustrates long‐term trends in overall cancer incidence
rates, which reflect both patterns in behaviors associated with
cancer risk and changes in medical practice, such as the use of
cancer screening tests. For example, the spike in incidence for males
during the early 1990s reflects a surge in the detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer as a result of widespread rapid uptake of
prostate‐specific antigen (PSA) testing among previously unscreened
men.36 Thereafter, cancer incidence in men generally decreased
until around 2013, then stabilized through 2019. In women, the rate
was fairly stable until the mid‐1980s but has since increased slowly
by <0.5% per year.5,37 Consequently, the sex gap is slowly narrowing, with the male‐to‐female incidence rate ratio declining from
1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57–1.61) in 19926 to 1.14 (95%
CI, 1.14–1.15) in 2019.25 However, differences in risk vary widely by
age. For example, rates among individuals aged 20–49 years are
about 80% higher in females than in males, whereas, among those
aged 75 years and older, they are nearly 50% higher in men.
The incidence rate for prostate cancer dropped by about 40%
from 2007 to 2014 (Figure 3) because of declines in the diagnosis
of localized tumors through PSA testing, the prevalence of which
decreased after the United States Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) recommended against screening for men aged 75 years
and older in 2008 and for all men in 2012.38,39 However, the
prostate cancer incidence rate has risen by 3% per year from 2014
through 2019, translating to 99,000 more cases than would have
occurred if rates had remained stable, approximately half of which
were advanced. This uptick is driven by increases of about 4.5%
annually for regional‐stage and distant‐stage diagnoses that began
as early as 2011 and are being watched closely.37 Localized‐stage
disease has also begun to tick up, although the trend is not yet
statistically significant. These patterns are consistent with
continued reports of a shift toward higher grade and stage at
prostate cancer diagnosis since circa 2010.40 Efforts to recoup the
benefit of early prostate cancer detection while mitigating overdiagnosis and overtreatment include a USPSTF upgrade to
informed decision making in men aged 55–69 in 201841,42 and
more targeted screening for clinically significant tumors using
molecular markers and magnetic resonance imaging‐targeted biopsy.43,44 Black men benefit more from screening in general45,46
and from the integration of personalized biomarkers because they
are more likely to harbor genomically aggressive cancer, even with
clinically low‐risk disease.47 Prostate cancer mortality rates in

Black men are approximately two to four times higher than those
in every other racial and ethnic group (Table 5).
Female breast cancer incidence rates have been slowly
increasing by about 0.5% per year since the mid‐2000s, largely driven
by diagnoses of localized‐stage and hormone receptor‐positive disease.48 This trend has been attributed at least in part to continued
declines in the fertility rate and increases in excess body weight,49
which may also contribute to increased uterine corpus cancer incidence of about 1% per year since the mid‐2000s among women aged
50 years and older and nearly 2% per year since at least the mid‐
1990s in younger women.37,50 After decades of increase, thyroid
cancer incidence rates have declined since 2014 by about 2% per
year because of changes in clinical practice designed to mitigate over
detection, including recommendations against thyroid cancer
screening by the USPSTF, and for more restrictive criteria for performing and interpreting biopsies by professional societies.51,52 Data
from autopsy studies indicate that the occurrence of clinically relevant thyroid tumors has remained stable since 1970 and is generally
similar in men and women, despite three‐fold higher overall incidence
rates in women.53,54
Lung cancer incidence has declined at a steady pace since 2006–
2007 by 2.6% annually in men and by 1.1% annually in women.37
Declines in lung cancer incidence began later and have been slower
in women than in men because women took up cigarette smoking in
large numbers later and were also slower to quit, including upturns in
smoking prevalence in some birth cohorts.55,56 In contrast, CRC
incidence patterns have been similar by sex since at least the mid‐
1970s, with rates declining by 1.4%–1.5% per year since 2012 in
both men and women.37 However, these rates are driven by cancer
occurrence in older age groups, for whom screening has been recommended, and mask increasing trends in young adults. Compared
with declines of 2% per year in people aged 50 years and older during
that time period, rates increased by almost 2% per year in adults
younger than 50 years. Rising incidence in the United States and
several other high‐income countries since the mid‐1990s57 remains
unexplained but likely reflects changes in lifestyle exposures that
began with generations born circa 1950.58
After a long history of increase, incidence of non‐Hodgkin lymphoma decreased by about 1% per year during 2015 through 2019,
and melanoma and liver cancer have stabilized. However, progress

for the latter two cancers is mostly confined to men, among whom
rates declined by about 1% per year for melanoma and by 2.6% per
year for liver cancer in those younger than 50 years and were stable
in older men. In women, melanoma was stable in those younger than
50 years but continued to increase by about 1% per year in older
women, whereas liver cancer increased by 1.6%–1.7% per year in
both age groups.37 The decline in urinary bladder cancer since the
mid‐2000s accelerated from 0.6% per year to 1.8% per year during
2015 through 2019 overall; however, trends vary widely by race and
ethnicity, and incidence continues to increase by 1.3% per year in
AIAN individuals. Incidence also continued to increase by about 1%
annually in both men and women for cancers of the kidney and
pancreas and by 2.8% and 1.3% per year, respectively, for human
papillomavirus (HPV)‐associated oral cavity cancers.
Cervical cancer incidence has decreased by more than one half
since the mid‐1970s because of the widespread uptake of screening.
Although rates were stable during 2015 through 2019 overall, trends
vary by age, race, and ethnicity. For example, rates continued to
decline by about 2% annually in Black, Hispanic, and Asian American/
Pacific Islander (AAPI) women 50 years and older and by 1% annually
in younger Black and AAPI women; however, rates among younger
Hispanic women increased by 2% per year from 2012 through 2019.
This may at least in part reflect a change in the composition of the
young Hispanic population in the United States through immigration
and/or migration. For example, cervical cancer incidence rates among
women in Puerto Rico are 30% higher than those among mainland
Hispanic women59 and were recently reported to be increasing in
women younger than 65 years, perhaps due to increased HPV

the US Food and Drug Administration for use in females aged 9–
26 years.61,62 Thus, the first cohort of vaccinated adolescents is now
in their 20s. Among women aged 20–24 years, invasive cervical
cancer incidence rates declined by 3% annually from 1998 (2.1 per
100,000 persons) through 2012 (1.3 per 100,000 persons), then by
11.4% annually from 2012 through 2019 (0.5 per 100,000 persons;
Figure 4). The overall reduction during 2012 through 2019 was 65%,
compared with 33% during the previous 7‐year period (2005–2012).
Although a new joinpoint is not yet evident among women of color
because of sparse data, the decrease in rates during 2012 through
2019 was similar across race and ethnicity (White, 64%; Black, 69%;
Hispanic, 70%). Data for AAPI and AIAN women were too sparse to
analyze.
These findings are consistent with those of Mix et al., who reported declines in cervical squamous cell carcinoma of 22.5% per year
from 2010 through 2017 among women aged 15–20 years.63 Surprisingly large herd immunity has also been shown in the United States
based on data from the National Health Examination Survey during
2003 through 2018, with reductions in HPV‐16 and HPV‐18 infection
among sexually active females aged 14–24 years of 90% among those
who were vaccinated and 74% among those who were unvaccinated.64
Sweden was first to report a population‐level reduction in invasive
cervical cancer incidence of 78% among women who were vaccinated
before age 17 years in 2020.65 Shortly thereafter, an 87% reduction in
cervical cancer and a 97% reduction in grade 3 cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia was demonstrated among women aged 20–29 years who
were vaccinated at ages 12 to 13 years in England.66 Although up‐to‐
date (three‐dose) HPV vaccination coverage in the United States has
lagged behind other countries, accumulating evidence suggests that a
single dose offers substantial protection67,68 and may even be preferable in low‐income, high‐burden populations.69 In April, 2022, the
World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on
Immunization endorsed single‐dose vaccination among girls aged 9–
14 years to address the global shortfall and optimize cancer prevention.70 In 2021, 79% of adolescent girls in the United States had
received at least one dose, and 64% were up to date.71
Cancer survival
The 5‐year relative survival rate for all cancers combined has
increased from 49% for diagnoses during the mid‐1970s to 68% for
diagnoses during 2012 through 2018 (Table 6).6,7 Current survival is
highest for cancers of the thyroid (98%), prostate (97%), testis (95%)
and for melanoma (94%), and lowest for cancers of the pancreas
(12%), liver and esophagus (21%). Screening influences the interpretation of survival improvements for breast and prostate cancers
because of lead‐time bias and the detection of indolent cancers,72
which is likely also a factor for thyroid and other cancers that can be
detected incidentally through imaging.73
Gains in survival have been especially rapid for hematopoietic
and lymphoid malignancies because of improvements in treatment
protocols, including the development of targeted therapies. For
example, the 5‐year relative survival rate for chronic myeloid leukemia has increased from 22% in the mid‐1970s to 70% for those
diagnosed during 2012 through 2018, and most patients who were
treated with tyrosine‐kinase inhibitors are experiencing near normal
life expectancy.74 More recently, a cascade of new therapies has

through 2018.7 Investigators at the NCI recently reported that the
number of individuals living with metastatic melanoma increased by
258% from 1990 to 2018, by far the largest increase among the six
common cancers studied.77
Immunotherapy has also shown promise in the neoadjuvant
setting for resectable stage II–IV cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma78 and nonsmall cell lung cancer. A phase 3 trial among patients
with stage I–III nonsmall cell lung cancer reported a median
progression‐free survival of 20.8 months with standard chemotherapy versus 31.6 months with the addition of nivolumab, including
a pathologic complete response in one of four patients.79 At the
population level, 3‐year relative survival for all stages of lung cancer
combined increased from 22% for diagnoses during 2004 through
2006 to 33% for diagnoses during 2016 through 2018, with progress
against nonsmall cell lung cancer (from 25% to 38%) far exceeding
that for small cell lung cancer (from 9% to 12%). Gains not only
reflect improved therapies80,81 but also earlier lung cancer detection82,83 and advances in staging84 and surgical procedures.85
Checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies are also showing

Unlike most common cancers, survival has not improved over the
past 4 decades for women with uterine malignancies (Table 6), largely
reflecting a lack of major treatment advances.87,88 Uterine corpus
cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, yet
there is a dearth of research activity89 and it ranked 24th in NCI
research funding in 2018.90 The lack of progress has disproportionately affected Black women, who are substantially less likely to be
diagnosed with localized‐stage disease (57% versus 72% of White
women; Figure 5) and have lower survival for every stage (Figure 6).

groups for every histologic subtype of uterine corpus cancer.91 The
recent identification of distinct molecular subtypes offers opportunities for the development of targeted therapies, which could have a
large impact because almost one half of early stage, recurrent endometrial cancers have targetable molecular alterations.92,93 However,
equitable dissemination of future advances will be critical to avoid
exacerbating the current disparity, which is already one of the largest
of all cancers. Stagnant survival trends for cervical cancer likely reflect
in part an increased proportion of adenocarcinoma, which has poorer
survival than squamous cell carcinoma,94 because of the disproportionate detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and early invasive squamous cell carcinoma during cytology screening.95
Survival rates are lower for Black individuals than for White individuals for every cancer type shown in Figure 6 except pancreas and
kidney cancers, for which they are similar. However, kidney cancer
survival is lower in Black patients for every histologic subtype of the

disease and is only similar overall because of a higher proportion than
Whites of papillary and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
which have a better prognosis than other types of RCC.96 The largest
Black–White survival differences in absolute terms are for melanoma
(24%) and cancers of the uterine corpus (20%), the oral cavity and
pharynx (18%), and the urinary bladder (13%). Although these disparities partly reflect a later stage at diagnosis (Figure 5), Black individuals have lower stage‐specific survival for most cancer types
(Figure 6). After adjusting for stage, sex, and age, the risk of cancer
death is 33% higher in Black people and 51% higher in AIAN people
compared with White people.97
Trends in cancer mortality
Mortality rates are a better indicator of progress against cancer than
incidence or survival rates because they are less affected by biases
that result from changes in detection practice.98 The cancer death
rate rose during most of the 20th century (Figure 7), largely because
of a rapid increase in lung cancer deaths among men as a consequence of the tobacco epidemic. However, reductions in smoking as
well as improvements in early detection and treatment for some
cancers have resulted in a continuous decline in the cancer death rate
since its peak in 1991 at 215.1 per 100,000 persons. The overall drop

adjusted to the 2000 US standard population. Because of improvements in International Classification of Diseases coding over time,
numerator data for cancers of the lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, liver, and uterus differ from the contemporary time period. For
example, rates for lung and bronchus include pleura, trachea, mediastinum, and other respiratory organs.

of 33% through 2020 (143.8 per 100,000 persons) translates to an
estimated 3,820,800 fewer cancer deaths (2,582,800 in men and
1,238,000 in women) than if mortality had remained at its peak
(Figure 8). The number of averted deaths is twice as large for men
than for women because the death rate in men peaked higher and
declined faster (Figure 7).
The pace of decline in cancer mortality has slowly accelerated
from about 1% per year during the 1990s, to 1.5% per year during
the 2000s, and to 2% per year from 2015 through 2020 (Table 7).
Overall mortality trends are largely driven by lung cancer, for which
declines steepened similarly in men and women in recent years
because of treatment advances that have extended survival, as
mentioned earlier, as well as earlier detection.83 For example, the
annual decrease in lung cancer mortality accelerated from 3.1%
during 2005 through 2014 to 5.3% during 2014 through 2020 in men
and from 1.8% to 4.3% in women (Table 7). Overall, the lung cancer
death rate dropped by 58% from 1990 to 2020 in men and by 36%
from 2002 to 2020 in women.
Long‐term reductions in mortality for CRC—the second‐most
common cause of cancer death in men and women combined—also
contribute to overall progress, with rates dropping by 55% among
males since 1980 and by 61% among females since 1969. (CRC death
rates were declining in women before 1969, but earlier data years
are not exclusive of deaths from small intestine cancer.) The CRC
mortality rate decreased during the most recent decade (2011–
2020) by about 2% per year. However, similar to incidence, this trend
masks increasing mortality among young adults; the CRC death rate
continued to rise by 1.2% per year in individuals younger than
50 years and by 0.6% per year in those aged 50–54 years from 2005
through 2020.
Female breast cancer mortality peaked in 1989 and has since
decreased by 43% because of earlier diagnosis through mammography screening and increased awareness, coupled with improvements in treatment. Declines in breast cancer mortality have slowed
in recent years, from 2% to 3% annually during the 1990s and 2000s
to 1% annually from 2011 to 2020, perhaps reflecting the slight but
steady increase in incidence and stagnant mammography uptake in
recent years. Similarly, the slowing decline in prostate cancer mortality, from 3% to 4% annually during 1994 through 2013 to 0.6%
during 2013 through 2020, likely reflects the uptick in advanced‐
stage diagnoses associated with reductions in PSA testing since
2008.99,100 Prostate cancer mortality has declined by 53% since the
peak in 1993 because of earlier detection through widespread
screening with the PSA test and advances in treatment.101,102
The third leading cause of cancer death in men and women
combined is pancreatic cancer, for which mortality has increased
slowly in men, from 12.1 (per 100,000 men) in 2000 to 12.7 per
100,000 men in 2020, but remained relatively stable in women at
9.3–9.6 per 100,000 women. Liver cancer had the fastest increasing
mortality for decades, but rates have stabilized in women and began
a downturn in men (1.3% decline from 2017 to 2020; Table 7), mirroring patterns in incidence. Mortality declines of about 2% per year

improved treatment. In contrast, accelerated declines in ovarian
cancer mortality, from 2% per year to almost 4% per year from 2017

through 2019.37 Mortality rates continue to increase for uterine
corpus cancer, by about 1% per year, and, for oral cavity cancers
associated with HPV‐infection (cancers of the tongue, tonsil, and
oropharynx), by about 2% per year in men and 1% per year in women.
Recorded number of deaths in 2020
In total, 3,383,729 deaths were recorded in the United States in 2020,
an increase of 528,891 deaths over 2019 (Table 8); this was 34 times
larger than the increase from 2018 to 2019 (15,633 deaths). COVID‐
19 infection was the underlying cause of death for only two thirds of
the increase, highlighting a substantial excess burden in 2020 for other
causes.Most notably,the increase in heart disease deaths from 2019 to
2020 was 10‐fold larger than the increase from 2018 to 2019. Among
all leading causes, only chronic lower respiratory diseases had a drop in
deaths from 2019 to 2020, with a decrease in the age‐standardized
death rate of 4.7%; cancer was the only other cause for which the
death rate declined (by 1.5%). The impact ofthe pandemic on mortality
will continue to unfold over many years and will likely parallel the
disproportionate COVID‐19 burden in the United States compared
with other countries. For example, a recent study found that life expectancy continued to decline in the United States between 2020 and
2021 (based on provisional data) versus a slight recovery on average in
21 peer countries, widening the gap in life expectancy between the
United States and peer countries to >5 years (76.4 vs. 81.9 years).103
In 2020, cancer accounted for 18% of all deaths and remained
the second leading cause of death after heart diseases. However, it is
the leading cause of death among women aged 40–79 years and men
aged 60–79 years (Table 9). Table 10 presents the number of deaths
in 2020 for the five leading cancer types by age and sex. Brain and
other nervous system tumors are the leading cause of cancer death
among children and adolescents younger than 20 years. However,
CRC has surpassed brain tumors in men aged 20–39 years and is the
leading cause of cancer death among men aged 20–49 years, whereas
breast cancer leads among women in that age group. Despite being
one of the most preventable cancers, cervical cancer is consistently
the second leading cause of cancer death in women aged 20–
39 years (Table 10). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death
in both men and women aged 50 years and older, causing far more
deaths than breast cancer, prostate cancer, and CRC combined.
Cancer disparities by race and ethnicity
Overall cancer incidence is highest among White people, followed
closely by AIAN and Black people (Table 5). However, sex‐specific
incidence is highest in Black men, among whom rates during 2015
through 2019 were 79% higher than those in AAPI men, who have
the lowest rates, and 5% higher than those in White men, who rank
second. High overall cancer incidence in Black men is largely because
of prostate cancer, which is 70% higher than in White men, two times
higher than in AIAN and Hispanic men, and three times higher than in
AAPI men. Among women, AIAN and White women have the highest
incidence, which is 10% higher than that in Black women, who rank
third. However, AIAN and Black women have the highest cancer
mortality rates—16% and 12% higher, respectively—than White
women. Even more striking, Black women have 4% lower breast
cancer incidence than White women but 40% higher breast cancer
mortality, a disparity that has remained stagnant for the past decade.

The highest mortality rate for both sexes combined is among
AIAN people, followed closely by Black people. The death rate in
AIAN and Black men is double that in AAPI men and 18% higher than
that in White men. Among men and women combined, the Black–
White disparity in overall cancer mortality has declined from
a peak
of 33% in 1993 (279.0 vs. 210.5 per 100,000 persons, respectively) to
12% in 2020 (166.8 vs. 149.3 per 100,000 persons). Notably, progress
is driven by faster declines in smoking
‐related cancers because of the
steep drop in smoking initiation among Black teens from the late
1970s to the early 1990s,104 as opposed to targeted efforts to reduce
inequalities.
Racial disparities are largely
a consequence of less access to high
‐
quality care across the cancer continuum. However, increasing access
alone is insufficient to close these gaps. For example, even among individuals with a median annual household income of ≥$75,000, 5‐year
relative cancer survival is lower among Black people (67%)than among
White people (72%).105 Similarly,
a recent study based on information
in the National Cancer Database found that Black individuals residing
in neighborhoods with the highest socioeconomic status are more
likely than White individuals residing in neighborhoods with the
lowest socioeconomic status to be diagnosed with advanced
‐stage
lung cancer.106 Even for childhood cancer, Black children are 24%
more likely to be diagnosed with distant
‐stage disease than White
children, regardless of family insurance status.107
Racial disparities in cancer occurrence and outcomes are largely
the result of longstanding inequalities in wealth that lead to differences in both risk factor exposures and access to equitable cancer
prevention, early detection, and treatment.108,109 Ultimately,
disproportionate wealth stems from hundreds of years of structural
racism, including segregationist and discriminatory policies in criminal justice, housing, education, and employment that have altered
the balance of prosperity, security, and other social determinants of
health.110 The social determinants of health are defined by the World
Health Organization as the conditions in which individuals are born,
grow, live, work, and age111 because these influences are consistently
and strongly associated with life expectancy and disease mortality.112,113 The most recent example is the disproportionate impact of
the COVID
‐19 pandemic on people of color in the United
States.3,4,114
A recent study by researchers at the NCI observed that
Black, AIAN, and Hispanic individuals had double the rate of overall
excess deaths in 2020 compared with White individuals and had two
to four times the rate of non–COVID
‐19–related excess deaths.115
Furthermore, routine health care, such as mammography screening,
that was suspended early in the pandemic has been slower to
rebound among people of color.116
Geographic variation in cancer occurrence
Tables 11 and 12 show cancer incidence and mortality rates for
selected cancers by state. State variation reflects differences in the
prevalence of cancer risk factors, such as smoking and obesity; preTABLE

to care. The largest geographic variation is for the most preventable
cancers, such as lung cancer, cervical cancer, and melanoma of the
skin. For example, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in
Kentucky, where smoking prevalence was historically highest, are
three to four times higher than those in Utah and Puerto Rico, where
it was lowest. These patterns are also consistent with contemporary
smoking prevalence. In 2020, the highest smoking prevalence was in
West Virginia (23%), Kentucky (21%), Mississippi (20%), and Arkansas (20%) compared with 8% in Utah and California and 10% in New
Jersey, Maryland, and Puerto Rico.117
Despite being one of the most preventable cancers, cervical
cancer incidence varies 2‐fold by state, ranging from 5 or less per
100,000 women in Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and
Maine to 10 per 100,000 women in Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Alabama and 13 per 100,000 women in Puerto Rico (Table 11). Ironically, advances in cancer control typically exacerbate disparities
because of the unequal dissemination of interventions across populations. Although HPV vaccination can virtually eliminate cervical
cancer,66 large state differences in coverage will likely widen existing
disparities. In 2020, up‐to‐date HPV vaccination among boys and

girls aged 13–17 years ranged from 32% in Mississippi and 43% in
West Virginia to 73% in Massachusetts, 74% in Hawaii, and 83% in
Rhode Island.118 State/territory differences in initiatives to improve
health, such as Medicaid expansion, may also contribute to future
geographic disparities.119,120
Cancer in children and adolescents
Cancer is the second most common cause of death among children
aged 1–14 years in the United States, surpassed only by accidents,
and is the fourth most common cause of death among adolescents
(aged 15–19 years). In 2023, an estimated 9910 children (from birth
to age 14 years) and 5280 adolescents (aged 15–19 years) will be
diagnosed with cancer, and 1040 and 550, respectively, will die from
the disease. About 1 in 260 children and adolescents will be diagnosed with cancer before age 20 years.9
Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, accounting for
28% of cases, followed by brain and other nervous system tumors
(26%), nearly one third of which are benign or borderline malignant
(Table 13). Cancer types and their distribution in adolescents differ
from those in children; for example, brain and other nervous system
tumors, more than one half of which are benign or borderline malignant, are the most common cancer (21%), followed closely by
lymphoma (19%). In addition, there are one half as many cases of
non‐Hodgkin lymphoma as Hodgkin lymphoma among adolescents;
whereas, among children, the reverse is true. Thyroid carcinoma and
melanoma of the skin account for 12% and 3% of cancers, respectfully, in adolescents but for only 2% and 1% of cancers in children.
The overall cancer incidence rate stabilized in children during
2010 through 2019 after increasing since at least 1975, but
continued to rise in adolescents by 1% per year. In contrast, death
rates per 100,000 persons declined from 1970 through 2020
continuously from 6.3 to 1.9 per 100,000 persons in children and
from 7.2 to 2.6 per 100,000 persons in adolescents, for overall
reductions of 70% and 64%, respectively. Much of this progress
reflects the dramatic declines in mortality for leukemia of 84% in
children and 75% in adolescents. Remission rates of 90%–100%
have been achieved for childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia over
the past 4 decades, primarily through the optimization of established chemotherapeutic regimens as opposed to the development
of new therapies.121 However, progress among adolescents has
lagged behind that in children, partly because of differences in
tumor biology, clinical trial enrollment, treatment protocols, and
tolerance and compliance with treatment.122 Mortality reductions
from 1970 to 2020 are also lower in adolescents for other common cancers, including non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (94% in children
and 88% in adolescents) and brain and other nervous system

tumors (39% and 25%, respectively). The 5‐year relative survival
rate for all cancers combined improved from 58% during the mid‐
1970s to 85% during 2012 through 2018 in children and from
68% to 86% in adolescents, but varies substantially by cancer type
and age at diagnosis (Table 13).
LIMITATIONS
The estimated numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in 2023
provide a reasonably accurate portrayal of the contemporary cancer
burden. However, they are model‐based, 3‐year (mortality) and 4‐
year (incidence) ahead projections that should not be used to track
trends over time for several reasons. First, new methodologies are
adopted regularly, most recently as of the 2021 estimates,26,27 to
take advantage of improved modeling techniques and cancer surveillance coverage. Second, although the models are robust, they can
only account for trends through the most recent data year (currently,
2019 for incidence and 2020 for mortality) and thus do not reflect
reduced access to cancer care because of the COVID‐19 pandemic.
Similarly, the models cannot anticipate abrupt fluctuations for cancers affected by changes in detection practice, such as those that
occur for prostate cancer because of changes in PSA testing. Third,
the model can be oversensitive to sudden or steep changes in
observed data. The most informative metrics for tracking cancer
trends are age‐standardized or age‐specific cancer incidence rates
from the SEER Program, the NPCR, and/or the NAACCR and cancer
death rates from the NCHS.
Errors in reporting race and ethnicity in medical records and on
death certificates result in underestimated cancer incidence and
mortality in persons who are not White, particularly Native American populations. Although racial misclassification in mortality data
among Native Americans is somewhat mitigated because of newly
available adjustment factors published by researchers at the NCHS,
these are currently only available for all cancers combined.22 It is
also important to note that cancer data in the United States are
primarily reported for broad, heterogeneous racial and ethnic
groups, masking important differences in the cancer burden within
these populations. For example, although lung cancer incidence is
approximately 50% lower in AAPI men than in White men overall, it
is equivalent in Native Hawaiian men, who are classified within this
broad category.123
CONCLUSION
The cancer mortality rate has decreased continuously since 1991,
resulting in an overall drop of 33% and approximately 3.8 million
cancer deaths averted. This steady progress is because of reductions in smoking; uptake of screening for breast, colorectal, and
prostate cancers; and improvements in treatment, such as adjuvant
chemotherapies for colon and breast cancers. More recently, advances in the development of targeted treatment and immunotherapy have accelerated progress in lung cancer mortality well
beyond reductions in incidence and are reflected in large mortality
reductions for cancers with increasing or stable incidence (leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer). Treatment breakthroughs have
particularly improved the management of some difficult‐to‐treat
cancers, such as nonsmall cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma. Of concern are rising incidence for breast, prostate, and

uterine corpus cancers, all of which have a wide racial disparity in
mortality and are amenable to early detection. Expanding access to
care and increasing investment for the broad application of
existing cancer control interventions and for research to advance
treatment options and develop successful interventions to reduce
inequalities would help mitigate disparities and accelerate progress
against cancer.
