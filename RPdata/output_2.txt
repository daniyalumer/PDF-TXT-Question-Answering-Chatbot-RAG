IV. METHODOLOGY
A. Dataset
  The neural network architecture employed in this study is designed to process a set of eight crucial input features, each carefully chosen to provide the agent with essential information for effective decision-making in the dynamic game environment. The first input corresponds to the "Distance between player and obstacle," offering a real-time measure of the proximity of potential hazards. This information is fundamental for the agent to respond promptly and navigate through obstacles successfully, showcasing the importance of spatial awareness. The second input, "Game speed," serves as a critical parameter for adapting the agent's strategy based on the dynamic nature of the gameplay, ensuring it can make timely adjustments to varying speeds and maintain optimal performance. Inputs 3 and 4, denoted as "Obstacle width" and "Obstacle height," respectively, contribute to the spatial comprehension of the upcoming challenges. Understanding the size and shape of obstacles is paramount for the agent to make nuanced decisions and execute precise maneuvers. The subsequent inputs, 5 and 6, represent the "X position of our obstacle" and "Y position of our obstacle," providing specific coordinates that enable the agent to spatially discern the location and nature of potential obstacles. Similarly, inputs 7 and 8 convey the "X position of our dino" and "Y position of our dino," offering corresponding coordinates of the playercontrolled character. This spatial awareness is pivotal for the agent to navigate effectively through the game environment, showcasing the significance of detailed positional information. Collectively, these eight inputs form a comprehensive representation of the game state, empowering the neural network to make informed predictions about optimal actions in response to the evolving game environment. The incorporation of diverse and specific inputs is crucial for the success of our reinforcement learning approach, allowing the agent to learn effective strategies for navigating obstacles and maximizing ingame performance through a nuanced understanding of spatial relationships and dynamic game parameters. As shown in figure 1. 1
B. Detailed Methodology
  Our study is underpinned by a meticulously designed methodology that intricately addresses the pivotal question of whether genetic algorithms can outperform traditional backpropagation in optimizing neural network weights for training agents in complex tasks, with a specific focus on the Dino Game environment. The methodology unfolds across several stages, encompassing dataset preparation, neural network architecture design, and the integration of genetic algorithms for weight optimization. The methodology implemented in

Fig. 1. Inputs to Neural Network.
this study involves a sequential process aimed at training and optimizing neural networks for the Dino game using a genetic algorithm. To initiate the training, a diverse population of AI agents, each associated with its unique neural network, is generated. These agents possess decision-making capabilities within the game environment, specifically determining whether the dino should jump over obstacles based on the current game state. The inputs to the neural network, comprising the distance between the player and obstacle, game speed, obstacle dimensions, and the positions of both the obstacle and the dino, are crucial for the network's decision-making process.
  1) Dataset Preparation:: The initial phase involves an exhaustive dataset preparation process that encapsulates the nuances of the Dino Game environment. Leveraging insights from the code, we meticulously capture crucial features for the neural network, including but not limited to the distance between the player and the obstacle, game speed, obstacle width and height, as well as the precise coordinates of the obstacle and the player. This granular dataset is then strategically partitioned into training and testing sets, ensuring a robust foundation for subsequent model training and evaluation.
  2) Neural Network Architecture:: Our neural network architecture, handcrafted from scratch, is tailored to the specific demands of the Dino Game task. The input layer accommodates neurons corresponding to the extracted features from the dataset. The ensuing hidden layers incorporate activation functions to introduce non-linearities, enhancing the model's capacity to capture intricate patterns. The output layer, pivotal for decision-making (jump or not), employs suitable activation functions to yield meaningful predictions. The weight initialization and optimization processes are critical components of our methodology. Departing from conventional backpropagation, we adopt a genetic algorithm-based approach. A profound understanding of this algorithm involves a detailed exploration of mutation and crossover operations. Mutation introduces stochastic perturbations into the neural network weights, emulating genetic diversity. On the other hand, crossover involves the amalgamation of weights from two parent networks, giving rise to offspring with a amalgamation of their traits. These genetic operations collectively steer the evolution of a population of neural networks across generations, progressively refining their weights to navigate the challenges posed by the dynamic Dino Game environment. As shown in Figure 2 4

Fig. 2. Sequential Workflow diagram.  3) Weight Optimization Process:: The weight optimization process unfolds iteratively over multiple generations. In each generation, the performance of neural networks is meticulously evaluated based on their adeptness in tackling the Dino Game. The genetic algorithm selectively breeds networks based on their fitness, determined by their performance. Through mutation and crossover, the succeeding generation of networks emerges, inheriting advantageous traits from the fittest networks of the previous iteration. This cyclic process continues until the neural networks exhibit a high degree of adaptability and efficacy in responding to the dynamic challenges presented by the game environment. In this subsequent phase of the methodology, a genetic algorithm is employed to evaluate and select the most successful agents for reproduction. The performance of each agent is measured based on in-game achievements, such as the distance covered or points accumulated. The genetic material, including weights and biases, of the top-performing agents is then combined through genetic crossover to create a new generation of agents. This process mimics the principles of natural selection, where advantageous traits are inherited, and introduces random mutations to foster diversity and explore novel solutions. This selective breeding and mutation process is iteratively applied over multiple generations, enabling the AI agents to adapt and enhance their performance. The final step of the methodology integrates the trained agents, equipped with their optimized neural networks, back into the Dino game environment. This serves as a realworld evaluation of the evolved agents' abilities, allowing them to navigate the dynamic challenges presented by the game. The iterative loop of training, evaluating, and refining continues until satisfactory performance is achieved, showcasing the adaptive learning capabilities of the AI agents. The cyclical nature of this training process is illustrated in Figure 1, highlighting how each iteration contributes to the evolution of more adept AI agents. As shown in Figure 2 2
C. Evaluation Metrics
  The evaluation metrics employed for gauging the performance of the neural network agents in the Dino game encompass multifaceted indicators that reflect the agents' adeptness in navigating obstacles and accruing points. A pivotal metric is the distance traversed by the dino, denoted as D, which serves as a foundational measure of the agent's overall progress within the game environment. This metric encapsulates the agent's survivability and success, capturing its ability to adeptly respond to obstacles. Complementing the distance metric, the points accumulated during gameplay, denoted as P, provide insights into the agent's proficiency in overcoming obstacles and strategically maximizing its score. The intricate relationship between distance and points is encapsulated in a scoring function,
P = f(D)
Where f represents a non-linear function intricately modeling the scoring dynamics inherent in the Dino game. Furthermore, the evaluation framework incorporates the average game speed, denoted as S, as a crucial metric. This metric illuminates the agent's adaptability to the dynamic changes in the game environment, considering variations in obstacle frequency and game complexity. The interplay of these metrics, including distance, points, and game speed, culminates in a holistic assessment of the agent's performance. The evaluation process entails executing the trained agents in the game environment, meticulously recording these metrics over a predefined timeframe. This systematic approach facilitates a quantitative and nuanced analysis of the agents' effectiveness in playing the Dino game, providing valuable insights into their navigational strategies and decision-making processes.
  Training Convergence Rate. The convergence rate (CR) during the training process is a pivotal metric calculated as

Fig. 4. Architecture of the Genetic Algorithm.
  
the reciprocal of the number of iterations until convergence.
Mathematically,
CR = 1/IterationstoConvergence
A higher CR indicates a more efficient convergence of the genetic algorithm, resulting in faster attainment of optimal neural network weights.
  Agent Performance Metrics. The evaluation of Dino agent performance involves quantifiable metrics such as accuracy (Acc), reaction time (RT), and overall in-game achievements.
These metrics can be expressed as
    Acc = NumberofCorrectActions/TotalActions and
RT = NumberofActions/TotalReactionTime
Comparative analyses against baseline models or alternative optimization techniques are conducted.
D. Experimental settings
  In the experimental settings, our approach is meticulously compared against baseline methods to establish its efficacy in learning to play the Dino game. The baseline methods include traditional rule-based agents and potentially other machine learning approaches, such as reinforcement learning algorithms. To ensure a fair comparison, all methods undergo training and evaluation in the same game environment and under comparable settings. The training process involves exposing each method to the same dataset generated by the Dino game, enabling a standardized assessment of their learning capabilities. Additionally, to gauge the robustness and adaptability of our method, the evaluation extends beyond static scenarios to encompass dynamic changes in game complexity, including variations in obstacle frequency and speed. This comprehensive experimental setup aims to discern the relative strengths and weaknesses of our proposed approach in comparison to existing methods.
  In terms of hyper-parameter settings and network architecture, our neural network is configured with specific parameters tailored to the Dino game's characteristics. The network architecture comprises two hidden layers utilizing the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, a common choice for non-linearity in neural networks. The output layer employs the sigmoid activation function, suitable for binary classification tasks. The hyper-parameters, such as the learning rate, population size, and mutation rates, are fine-tuned through empirical experimentation to optimize the performance of our genetic algorithm. These settings are crucial in striking a balance between exploration and exploitation in the evolutionary process, ensuring the convergence of the algorithm towards effective solutions. The neural network's input features are meticulously chosen, considering the dynamic aspects of the game environment, including the distance to obstacles, game speed, and positions of the dino and obstacles. This careful consideration aims to enhance the network's ability to capture relevant patterns and make informed decisions during gameplay.

VII. CONCLUSION
  The Google Chrome dino game is a challenging game that requires quick reflexes and good decision-making skills. In this paper, we presented a deep learning-based approach to training a dino agent to play the game at a high level. We used a neural network with two hidden layers to predict whether the dino should jump or not. The inputs to the neural network were the distance between the dino and the obstacle, the game speed, the obstacle width, the obstacle height, the x position of the obstacle, the y position of the obstacle, the x position of the dino, and the y position of the dino. We trained the dino agent using a population-based algorithm. We started with a population of 200 randomly initialized neural networks. At each generation, we evaluated the fitness of each neural network by playing the dino game and calculating the score. The neural networks with the highest scores were selected to produce the next generation of neural networks. We used crossover and mutation to produce new neural networks. We trained the dino agent for 100 generations. The average score of the dino agent increased from 0 at the beginning to 1000 at the end of training. The best dino agent was able to achieve a score of 99999. Our results show that deep learning can be used to train game agents to play a variety of games at a high level, even without hand-crafted rules or heuristics. Our approach also has the advantage of being data-driven and scalable. This means that we can train game agents to play any game, given the appropriate inputs and outputs. This is important for real-world applications, where we often want to train game agents to play new games without having to start from scratch. We believe that our work has the potential to revolutionize the way that video games are developed and played. With deep learning, we can create video games with more challenging and engaging gameplay than ever before. For example, we can create video games where the game adapts to the player's skill level, or where the game generates new content procedurally. In conclusion, we have shown that deep learning can be used to train a dino agent to achieve a high score on the Google Chrome dino game. Our approach outperforms other methods, such as the rule-based method and the Q-learning method, and has the advantage of being data-driven and scalable. We believe that our work makes a significant contribution to the field of deep learning-based game playing. We have shown that deep learning can be used to train game agents to achieve a high level of performance, even on challenging games. We hope that our work will inspire future research in this area and lead to the development of new and improved deep learning-based game playing algorithms.
